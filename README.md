# HTML Cat Dance Project

This HTML project displays a cat image dancing and includes an audio element to accompany the animation. The page shows a fun, interactive way to display images and play audio simultaneously.

## Features

- **Dancing Cat Image**: The cat image (`CAT.png`) is animated using CSS to create a dancing effect.
- **Audio**: An audio player automatically plays the `dangerous.mp3` file as background music using the `<audio>` element.
- **External CSS**: The webpage's design and animation are controlled using an external `styling.css` file.

## Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure and media elements.
- **Moon.jpg**: An image of the moon (not currently used in animation but part of the initial design).
- **CAT.png**: An image of a cat used for the dancing animation.
- **dangerous.mp3**: An MP3 file that plays automatically in the browser.
- **styling.css**: A CSS file for styling the webpage, including the dancing animation for the cat image.
